* Python Project Cookiecutter

** Installation

There is no specific package to install just make sure you have
cookiecutter installed, roughly:

#+begin_src bash
pip install cookiecutter
#+end_src

Then you can just make repos from the template:

#+begin_src bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/salotz/salotz-py-cookiecutter.git
#+end_src

Where you will be prompted for details.

** COMMENT Getting Started

Once you have a project made go into that directory and install the
basic tooling requirements for running the automation. Do this in a
general purpose python environment, not much will be installed. There
is automation for repo specific environments that we will do later.

#+begin_src bash
pip install -r tools.requirements.txt
#+end_src

Now you can see which commands are available to you by running this
command:

#+begin_src bash
inv -l
#+end_src

This is using the 'invoke' CLI to look inside of the 'tasks' directory
to get the available commands.

You should always run 'inv' from this root of the project.

Now we can initialize the project which will generate some folders and
set up version control.

#+begin_src bash
inv project.init
#+end_src

Then we can make our environment to actually do stuff in:

#+begin_src bash
inv env.dev
#+end_src

# TODO: this is not implemented as my tasks module thing in my
# cookiecutter
If you want to update the built-in task modules run:

#+begin_src bash
inv update.update
#+end_src

** COMMENT Configuring Tasks

Configuration is done in the ~tasks/config.py~. Don't edit the
~tasks/sysconfig.py~ as this is managed by the update process.

** COMMENT Custom Automation Tasks

If you want to add custom automation to the interface you can start by
adding invoke tasks to the ~tasks/plugins/custom.py~ file.

Otherwise you will need to make new modules in the plugins dir and
install them in the config file.
